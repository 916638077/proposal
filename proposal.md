# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

CS2 Knife Craft Analyzer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that shows users the items required to trade up to a selected knife/gloves in CS2


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Based on the selected item, the program outputs its collection, calculates the cheapest possible trade path, and displays the odds, total cost, potential outcomes, and profit changes.
The program gathers data from the Steam market, identifies the collection of the selected , and looks up the cheapest items required to get it. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make a program that outputs the lowest price required to craft a selected item.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can also make it output the collection the item is from, odds of geetting the item, and profitability.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is if I can make the program output all the neccessary infromation and also use matplotlib to graph the information for a better visibility. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to collect real data from a website, how to work with it. I will also need to learn how to work matplotlib in order to display the data on a graph.
